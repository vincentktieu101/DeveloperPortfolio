        In Spring of my junior year at UCSB, I became an Undergraduate Learning
        Assistant (ULA) for CS148 (Computer Science Project), in which students
        learn how to develop an application. Since most students wanted to
        create a React application, I wrote some starter code in React CRA
        (CreateReactApp) along with Google OAuth. I also filmed a mini guide on
        how to use React/Google OAuth on YouTube as well as wrote a Github
        Readme.
