        This was my first time doing freelance work and I wrote the website from
        scratch in React GatsbyJS. The previous website that my aunt had for her
        shop was really outdated and I wanted to help them build a new one. The
        website includes some photos, a contact form (using EmailJS), and a menu
        that can be reached through a QR code.
