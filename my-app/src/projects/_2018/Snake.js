        I developed this project while I was still an Electrical Engineering
        major. This project has a special place in my heart because it helped me
        gain the confidence I needed to switch majors, especially since I knew
        that the path of a Computer Science major wasn't going to be an easy.
        Every now and again when I need inspiration, I boot up the game and
        enjoy this project I created.

        I wrote this app in Python and Pygame. I also wrote a mini programming
        guide that you can check out

        . I even designed an 8-bit music theme for the game!
