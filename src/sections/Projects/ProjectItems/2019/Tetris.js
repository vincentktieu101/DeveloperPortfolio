        Wanting to learn more about algorithms and OOP, I created a Tetris clone
        from scatch using Python and Pygame. I designed the game board, wrote
        the game rules which included algorithms for row clearing, shape
        swapping, and shape rotaton. There is also difficulty settings that
        users can tweak.
