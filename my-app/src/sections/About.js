              Hi! I'm <b>Vincent Tieu</b>, a <b>software engineer</b> and{" "}
              <b>full-stack web developer</b>, based in <b>Los Angeles</b>. I am
              passionate about programming, whether that means starting a web
              project from stratch (like this online portfolio!) or developing
              an existing code base. I am a programmer because I enjoy problem
              solving and view programming as a creative medium for achieving my
              goals.

              I'm currently a 3rd year <b>Computer Science</b> major at{" "}
              <b>UC Santa Barbara</b>, (already taken / currently taking)
              classes in Operating Systems, Compilers, Databases, Artificial
              Intellegence, Web Development, HCI, Networking, etc.

              However, I also enjoy learning outside of the classroom. Here is
              my online portfolio for my personal projects, something I wish I
              could elaborate more of on my resume.
