        This was my first time doing freelance work and I wrote the website
        from scratch in React GatsbyJS. The previous website that my aunt
        had for her shop was really outdated and I wanted to
        help them build a new one. The website includes some photos, a
        contact form (using EmailJS), and a menu that can be reached through
        a QR code.
