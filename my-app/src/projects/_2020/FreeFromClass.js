        FreeFromClass was a class project for CS48. This was my introduction
        into web development where I worked in a team of 4 to develop an app
        from scratch to deployment. Through this app, I learned everything from
        React NextJS, Auth0, MongoDB, Cypress testing, and Heroku. I learned
        lots of frontend skills, adjusting this app for mobile as well as
        desktop. I also learned how to build a REST API.
