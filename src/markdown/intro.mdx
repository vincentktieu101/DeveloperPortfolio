Hi! I'm **Vincent Tieu**, a **software engineer** and
**full-stack web developer**, based in **Los Angeles**. I am
passionate about programming, whether that means starting a web project
from scratch (like this online portfolio!) or developing an existing
codebase. I program because I enjoy problem-solving and want a creative
medium for achieving my goals.

I'm currently a 3rd year **Computer Science** major at{" "}
**UC Santa Barbara** graduating **December '21**. I already taken
classes in Data Structures & Algorithms, Operating Systems, Compilers,
Databases, Artificial Intelligence, Web Development, HCI, Networking,
etc.

However, I also enjoy learning outside of the classroom. Here is my
portfolio for my personal projects, something I wish I could elaborate
more of on my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1C_F7pFjvxAtaEg8cRhYUk0UfXWM83t63/view?usp=sharing" className="link link-ltr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">**resume**</a>.
